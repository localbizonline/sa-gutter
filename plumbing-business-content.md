### FAQ - Emergency Repairs
- **Question 1**:
  - **Question**: How quickly can you respond to an emergency?
  - **Answer**: We guarantee arrival within 60 minutes for all emergency calls throughout the Cape Town metro area. For Premium and Service Plan customers, we offer even faster response times of 45 and 30 minutes respectively.

- **Question 2**:
  - **Question**: Do you charge extra for after-hours emergency calls?
  - **Answer**: No, we charge the same rates 24/7. Unlike many plumbers, we don't believe you should pay more just because your emergency happens at night or on a weekend.

- **Question 3**:
  - **Question**: What counts as a plumbing emergency?
  - **Answer**: Any situation that risks property damage or makes your property uninhabitable: burst pipes, major leaks, complete drain blockages, geyser failures with active leaking, sewer backups, or no water supply. If you're unsure, call us and we'll help assess your situation.

- **Question 4**:
  - **Question**: Will my insurance cover emergency plumbing repairs?
  - **Answer**: Most homeowner's insurance policies cover sudden and accidental water damage from plumbing failures. We provide detailed documentation for insurance claims and can work directly with your insurance company when needed.

- **Question 5**:
  - **Question**: Do you provide temporary fixes or permanent solutions?
  - **Answer**: We always aim to provide permanent solutions during our first visit. Our emergency vehicles carry extensive parts inventories to handle most repairs completely. In rare cases where specialized parts are needed, we'll make your system safe and functional temporarily until the permanent repair can be completed.

- **Question 6**:
  - **Question**: What areas of Cape Town do you cover for emergency services?
  - **Answer**: We cover the entire Cape Town metropolitan area including all suburbs from Simon's Town to Durbanville, and from Sea Point to Somerset West. We also service the winelands areas of Stellenbosch and Paarl for an additional travel fee.

- **Question 7**:
  - **Question**: How can I minimize damage while waiting for you to arrive?
  - **Answer**: First, shut off your main water supply valve (usually near your water meter). For burst pipes or active leaks, place buckets to collect water and use towels to slow spreading. For geysers, turn off the power supply at your electrical panel. Our emergency dispatcher can guide you through these steps when you call.

- **Question 8**:
  - **Question**: What payment methods do you accept for emergency services?
  - **Answer**: We accept all major credit and debit cards, cash, EFT, Snapscan, and Zapper. Payment is required upon completion of work, and we can provide an electronic invoice immediately.
